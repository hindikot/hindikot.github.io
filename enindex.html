      <h6 class="geofizikakomite my-3" ><strong>National Geophysical Committee of Azerbaijan</strong></h6>
      <p>Azerbaijan National Geophysical Committee (AMGK) was established on October 28, 1993. In accordance with the statute of the CSC, the activities of the committee include the study of geodynamic processes in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, the prediction of underground mineral and energy resources, the development of efficient methods for the search and exploration of mineral deposits, the integration of Azerbaijani geophysics into international geophysical societies, the conduct of various types of research, international and national level conferences, symposiums and seminars, etc. covers the organization.</p>
      <p> One of the main activities of the National Geophysics Committee of Azerbaijan is the implementation of various thematic works related to the actual problems of oil and gas geology and geophysics of Azerbaijan, and these works include the following: - Atlas of petrophysical studies on Mesocenezoic sediments in Azerbaijan; Based on the analysis of 24,000 rocks, this atlas contains information on up to 20 petrophysical parameters.</p>
      <p>Atlas of elasticity and velocity models of Mesocenezoic sediments in Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea oil-gas basin. - Atlas of thermobaric parameters on terrigenous sediments of oil-gas depression zones of Azerbaijan. - Atlas of natural resources and mineral resources of Nakhchivan MR. - Depth structure map of the Black Sea-Caspian regional subduction zone. Tectonic and oil and gas zoning maps on land and sea areas of Azerbaijan. One of the important directions within the framework of the activity of the AMCK is the holding of Azerbaijan International geophysics conferences, which have already become a tradition. At these conferences, which are held every two years, current problems of oil and gas geology and geophysics, thematic and regional issues are discussed.</p> 
        <img src="style/carousel1.jpg" alt="" class="pss my-5 shadow w-100">
        <p>The first of this series of conferences, in which the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) of America also participated, was held in 1996, and the last one - XI, was held on October 16-18, 2019. The programs of the conferences, consisting of oral and stand sessions, reflect various sections of geophysics and geology, dozens of reports are heard. In these high-level conferences, along with the achievements of Azerbaijani geophysicists, the scientific and technological results of the world's leading oil countries and companies are discussed, and a real basis is created for the international integration of geophysical research.</p>
        <p>Seminars of republican importance were also organized by AMGK, among which the following can be noted: Prediction of hydrocarbon accumulations in non-anticlinal traps by geophysical exploration methods (November, 1998); Geophysical control of the development of oil fields of Azerbaijan (1998); "Seminar dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the discovery of oil rocks" (November, 1999); Extraordinary geological events (June, 2000); seminar-meeting with students of ASOSU (November 2016); Workshop of veteran geophysicists and geologists (June 2016); "Development prospects of petroleum geophysics in Azerbaijan" (October 2018), etc.</p>
        <p>Since 1996, within the framework of the activities of the AMSK, the periodical magazine "Geophysics Innovations in Azerbaijan" has been published for the first time in the Republic. The editorial board of the magazine makes great efforts to protect the high scientific-technical and polygraphic level of the published articles and writings. The publication of the articles and summaries published in the magazine in three languages ​​makes it possible to expand its scope and readership and make it known in the oil-producing countries of the world.</p>
        <p>The activity of AMGK also included a number of scientific-research, teaching and book-type works: "Prospects of oil and gas production of the South Caspian basin sedimentary layer" (authors - K.M. Karimov, R.R. Rahmanov, M.B. Kheyirov); Publication of the "Who's Who" collection about geophysicists who served in the development of Azerbaijani geophysics; English-Russian-Azerbaijani dictionary of geophysical terms - Compiler author - Doctor of Sciences Yusif Gambarov. In the regions of Azerbaijan with a complex geological structure, the search and exploration of oil and gas fields, mining geophysical works, as well as engineering geological works, in order to prevent inevitable technical-technological and geological complications, require strict adherence to the relevant instructions and rules. A number of guidelines have been developed by the specialists working with, among which the following can be mentioned: - "Technical guide on conducting geophysical research and works in oil and gas wells" was prepared and handed over for application to production; - "Instruction on seismic exploration"; - "Rules for conducting geophysical works in the accident-liquidation process". At the present time, AMGK continues its activities in this direction.</p>

In recent years, "8 March", "Bulla-deniz", "Oil Stones - Mud Pilpilesi", "Goshadash", "Gurgan-deniz - Chilov Island", "Mardakan Sea - Gala Bay", "Kur-Gabarri" inter-river on land 2D and 3D seismic exploration and gravimagnetometric exploration works were carried out in Neftli-Gasli region, "Yevlakh-Aghjabedi" depression, "Khidirli-Bandovan", "Mugan monocline - Jalilabad" depression. Received seismic data were processed and interpreted using modern programs. In addition, GGI has carried out seismic exploration and processing-interpretation works on the order of American "ConocoPhillips", British "bp", Norwegian "Equinor", Japanese "JOGMEC" companies, and these works are ongoing.</h6>

        <h5>The scientific-technical and information magazine "Geophysics Innovations in Azerbaijan" founded by the Azerbaijan National Geophysics Committee has been published since 1997. Over the years, dozens of articles and articles dedicated to the results of geophysical and geological research of our Republic and foreign scientists and specialists have been published in the magazine, and the magazine has gained international reputation. As a result of the high professionalism, demandingness, hard work and effort of the editorial staff, an interesting magazine in the field of petroleum geophysics has been created. After the table of contents, readers are presented with a brief summary of the articles published in the journal. The publication of the articles and summaries published in the magazine in three languages ​​- Azerbaijani, Russian and English, expands its scope and readership, and makes it possible to be known in the oil-producing countries of the world. The journal also publishes interesting events in the oil industry, informative articles, articles on the history of geophysics, the lives of famous geophysicists and geologists, and anniversary greetings.</h5>
